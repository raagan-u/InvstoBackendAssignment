With The Simple Moving Average Crossover there is the most potential buying point 
at the lowest where the Moving Averages crossover each other 
when bought in the first crossover have to face a price down once , 
but at the end where short MA overtakes the long MA and finally as we see 
the downtrend of the short MA after its peak and the crossover after that is the best point to sell and see maximum profits.

Since I am new to Trading I had to go with Simple Moving Average Crossover
I also am looking into better and easier strategies to implement
